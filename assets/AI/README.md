# Trix AI Agent Deployment Package

## Overview
This package contains the best-performing Trix AI agent trained for 50,000 episodes with a 31.7% win rate against random players.

## Package Contents
- `trix_agent_model.pt` - TorchScript model for cross-platform deployment
- `trix_agent_full.pt` - Full PyTorch model with all weights
- `agent_config.json` - Model configuration and metadata
- `performance_metrics.json` - Performance statistics and benchmarks
- `flutter_integration/` - Flutter integration files and examples

## Model Performance
- **Win Rate**: 31.7% (vs random players)
- **Training Episodes**: 50,000
- **Model Type**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **Performance Level**: Advanced Beginner
- **Model Size**: ~2MB

## Flutter Integration

### Prerequisites
Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  pytorch_lite: ^1.0.0

assets:
  - assets/models/trix_agent_model.pt
```

### Basic Usage
```dart
final aiAgent = TrixAIAgent();
await aiAgent.loadModel();

// Get game state as 84-dimensional vector
List<double> gameState = getGameState();

// Get AI prediction
List<double> predictions = await aiAgent.predictMove(gameState);
int bestMove = aiAgent.getBestAction(predictions);
```

### State Representation
The model expects a {self.state_size}-dimensional state vector representing:
- Player hands (cards distribution)
- Game phase information
- Score tracking
- Available actions

### Action Output
Returns {self.action_size}-dimensional action probabilities where each index represents a possible game action.

## Integration Steps

1. **Copy Model Files**
   - Place `trix_agent_model.pt` in `assets/models/`
   - Add asset reference to `pubspec.yaml`

2. **Add Dependencies**
   - Install PyTorch Lite Flutter package
   - Import the TrixAIAgent class

3. **Initialize Agent**
   ```dart
   final aiAgent = TrixAIAgent();
   await aiAgent.loadModel();
   ```

4. **Get Predictions**
   ```dart
   List<double> gameState = convertGameToState(currentGame);
   List<double> predictions = await aiAgent.predictMove(gameState);
   int aiMove = aiAgent.getBestAction(predictions);
   ```

## Performance Notes
- Model is optimized for CPU inference
- Inference time: <50ms on modern mobile devices
- Memory usage: ~10MB when loaded
- Suitable for real-time gameplay

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model Loading Fails**
   - Verify model file is in correct assets path
   - Check pubspec.yaml asset configuration

2. **Prediction Errors**
   - Ensure game state is exactly {self.state_size} dimensions
   - Verify data types (Float32List required)

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use release mode for better performance
   - Consider model quantization for smaller size

## Alternative Deployment Options

### TensorFlow Lite (if needed)
```bash
# Convert PyTorch to ONNX to TensorFlow Lite
pip install torch-to-tflite
python convert_to_tflite.py
```

### ONNX Runtime (if needed)
```bash
# Convert PyTorch to ONNX
pip install onnx
python convert_to_onnx.py
```
